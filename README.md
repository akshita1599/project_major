"Object + Text + Face detection app"
It is basically a mobile application for android OS. Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection. Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance. Scene text is text that appears in an image captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. Text detection is the process of detecting the text present in the image, followed by surrounding it with a rectangular bounding box. Text detection can be carried out using image based techniques or frequency based techniques. Text recognition can automate tedious data entry for credit cards, receipts, and business cards. In this app, user can click a picture and then after the image will be processed, the detected text and object will be shown.

The main objective is to:
1. Detect basic visible object from a captured image.
2. Detect text in a captured image, if present.
3. Detect face in a captured image, if present.

There are a number of mobile applications and computer software available for this purpose, each of them using a particular algorithm and many other complex calculations. Our motivation to do this project was to learn how the object and text detection schemes work in a very basic and simple manner. The basic aim is to build-up a system which will recognize objects and text from a picture.
